Time is money. People do not enough 24 hours these days, so start outsourcing activities to youtubers to play games and so on. They work instead of you. The person who accepts the most time outsourcing wins. Their a hour is for a hour for the million peoples. It value is same the million hours. The 24-hour rule is lost. Time is flooding from our lives. The next outsourcer is AI. They compress our time and history into bite-sized chunks. The speed of sound is slow to us, but if you use both hands and eyes, your ear is free to eat. That is why the last war was fought with audio speakers. We inject as much immaterial gold as we can. We can save our time, but saving is an old tactic already. We share and give our own time in order to maximize it. It looks ambivalent. We do not live alone, we are greedy. Our enemy is always time. Where is the lowest point of time? Time seeks its own level. There will be the gold mine.
