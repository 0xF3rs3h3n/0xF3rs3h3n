Time is money. People do not have enough 24 hours these days, so they start outsourcing activities like playing games to YouTubers. They work on your behalf. The person who accepts the most time wins. An hour for them represents an hour for millions of people. Its value is equivalent to a million hours. The 24-hour rule is becoming obsolete. Time is slipping away from our lives. The next wave of outsourcing is to AI. They compress our time and history into digestible pieces. To us, the speed of sound seems slow, but if you use both your hands and eyes, your ears are free to "eat". That's why the last war was fought with audio speakers. We inject as much immaterial gold as possible. We can save time, but saving is an outdated strategy. We share and give away our time to maximize its value. It seems contradictory. We do not live alone; we are greedy. Our perpetual enemy is time. Where is the deepest point of time? Time seeks its own level. There, lies the gold mine.
